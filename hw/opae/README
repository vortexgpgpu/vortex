use the following step to build vortex and run it on fpga on intel cloud server using OPAE. 
This script is also present at ~/dev/runVortex

## To configure quartus and opae. Run this after logging in.

#
## Synthesis
#

cd /driver/hw/opae

# Configure a Quartus build area
afu_synth_setup -s sources.txt build_fpga

# Run Quartus in the vLab batch queue
cd build_fpga && qsub-synth

# check last 10 lines in build log for possible errors
tail -n 10 ./build_fpga/build.log

# Check if the job is submitted to the queue and running. Status should be R 
qstat | grep tinebp

# Constantly monitoring the job submitted to the queue. Stop this using Ctrl+C 
watch ‘qstat | grep tinebp’

#
## Executing on FPGA
#

# From the build_fpga directory acquire a fpga node
qsub-fpga

# Go to the directory whree qsub-synth was run above
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR

# Load the image onto an FPGA
fpgaconf vortex_afu.gbs

# If this says Multiple ports. Then use --bus with fpgaconf. #bus info can be found by fpgainfo port
fpgaconf --bus 0xaf vortex_afu.gbs

# Running the Test case 
cd /driver/tests/basic
make run-fpga

#
## ASE build instructions

source /export/fpga/bin/setup-fpga-env fpga-pac-a10

# Acquire a sever node for running ASE simulations

# build
make ase
