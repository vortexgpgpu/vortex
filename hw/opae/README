use the following step to build vortex and run it on fpga on intel cloud server using OPAE. 
This script is also present at ~/dev/runVortex

## To configure quartus and opae. Run this after logging in.
source /export/fpga/bin/setup-fpga-env fpga-pac-a10

## Vortex Run commands ##
#########################
## Synthesis
cd /driver/hw/
# Configure a Quartus build area
afu_synth_setup -s sources.txt build_fpga
cd build_fpga
# Run Quartus in the vLab batch queue
qsub-synth
# Check if the job is submitted to the queue and running. Status should be R 
qstat | grep tinebp
# Constantly monitoring the job submitted to the queue. Stop this using Ctrl+C 
watch ‘qstat | grep tinebp’
## Executing on FPGA
# From the build_fpga directory acquire a fpga node
qsub-fpga
# Go to the directory whree qsub-synth was run above
cd $PBS_O_WORKDIR
# Load the image onto an FPGA
fpgaconf vortex_afu.gbs
# If this says Multiple ports. Then use --bus with fpgaconf. #bus info can be found by fpgainfo port
#fpgaconf --bus 0xaf vortex_afu.gbs
## Running the Test case 
cd /driver/opae
make clean
make
# For shared library
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${PWD}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# Run the program
cd /driver/tests/basic
make clean
make
./basic
